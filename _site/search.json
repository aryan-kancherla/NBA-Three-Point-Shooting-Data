    "text": "About This Project\nI’ve always been a fan of great 3-point shooters such as Stephen Curry, Ray Allen, and Damian Lillard, which led me to analyze the NBA’s 3-Point Shooting Data. From the knowledge I obtained through Kane’s Data Science Bootcamp, a 6-week free data science course, I was able to analyze and create graphs & models from the NBA’s 3-Point Shooting Data set, coming up with interesting conclusions."
